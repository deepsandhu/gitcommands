Steps to resolve conflicts:
Step-1 : Clone the Git Repository into Git Bash from GitLab by using the following command
                              git clone <<git URL>>
Step-2 : Checkout to the default branch and update it with remote by running the command,
                             git pull
Step-3 : Checkout to source branch and make sure the local source branch is up-to-date with remote by running,
                             git checkout <<source_branch-name>>
                              git pull origin <<source_branch_name>>
Step-4 : Checkout to the target branch where you want to merge the source branch and make sure the local target branch is up-to-date with the remote,
                              git checkout <<target_branch_name>>
                               git pull origin <<target_branch_name>>
Step-5 : Merge the source branch into the target branch by running the command,
                            git merge <<source_branch_name>>
Step-6 : Check if there are any conflicts from the merge by running the command,
                            git status
Step-7 : Above command will show up the conflicts in red color.
Step-8 : If we want to store the changes from the source branch run the command,
                            git checkout --ours .     --->   (for everything on that directory)
                            git checkout --ours <<file_name>>    --->   (for a particular file)
Step-9 : If we want to store the changes from the target branch into the source branch then run the command,
                            git checkout --theirs .     --->   for everything on that directory)
                            git checkout --theirs <<file_name>>    --->   (for a particular file)
Step-10 : After resolving the conflicts, commit the changes by running below commands.
                            git add .
                            git commit -m "commit message"
Step-11 : After commit push the changes to the remote repository by running the command,
                            git push origin <<source_branch>>

                            git push origin --delete <<branch_name>>
  To delete a feature branch on local repository
                            git branch -d <<branch_name>>
2. Rename a branch
  To rename your branch on local repository (If you are on the branch you want to rename)
                            git branch -m <<new_name>>
  To rename your branch on local repository (If you are on a different branch)
                           git branch -m <<old_name>> <<new_name>>
  To delete the old name remote branch (in remote repository) and push the new name local branch (from local repository)
